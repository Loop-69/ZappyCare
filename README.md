+
+ ## 🌪️ A Tale of Organized Chaos
+
+ Zappycare was born in the witching hour:
+ - Midnight Sketches: Napkin wireframes scribbled by a half‑awake dreamer.
+ - 2 AM Caffeine Alchemy: Supabase tables sparked to life under fluorescent kitchen lights.
+ - Dawn’s Debug Ritual: Tests, bug hunts, and code poetry before the sun even yawned.
+
+ Every “TODO” here is a wink from Sani—my matrix guardian.
